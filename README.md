# Big Data Analysis over Human Proteins with Apache Spark

![](mii_ssbw_icon.png)


This repo tries to solve classification problems using computational techniques based on Big Data. The framework used is Spark using the deep learning library `MLLib` and using the python wrapper: `pyspark`.

I leave a composition of containers to launch apache spark in cluster mode with Docker easily.

```bash
docker-compose up
```
